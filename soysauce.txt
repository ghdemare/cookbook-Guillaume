- buy soysauce from your favorite convenience store.
- does not really matter which store you get it from, just make sure ist soy sauce and not ketchup or whatever, because that would intrinsically undermine the purpose of getting yourself soy sauce.
- the same is true of curry or bbq sauce
- just make sure you really get soy sauce
- if in doubt, ask an employee of the store
